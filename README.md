This can be our notes on what we edit and why

I found a really useful article on how to set up the lamp server.
https://www.linode.com/docs/web-servers/lamp/install-lamp-stack-on-ubuntu-18-04/

I basically followed that step by step and set it all up on a new instance of ubuntu on aws.
Although I suppose no matter how you had an instance of Linux running this would work but we might want to demo it on an aws instance just for convenience of knowing its running on their servers.

This video is also pretty useful to briefly explain how github works.
