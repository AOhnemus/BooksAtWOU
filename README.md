# Books-WOU

Files for a website running with LAMP. Some configuration will need to be done server side to intergrate it. Originally used with AWS virtual machines running command line Ubuntu. The site is intended to be similar to craigslist, focused solely on Western Oregon University students trying to sell and purchase textbooks without the middleman of the WOU Book Store or any other services.
