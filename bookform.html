I'll rename it later, bookform.html is a terrible name. Just wrote it while I was working, didn't know if it'd turn out
to be the finished thing. Shouldn't be too hard to change the name and pointers but I'm not screwing with that right now,
trying to get all our ducks in a row for the presentation. -->
